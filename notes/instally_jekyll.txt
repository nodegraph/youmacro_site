Open Command Prompt which can be found in All Apps -> Windows System -> Command Prompt. Right click on the icon, select “More” then “Run as administrator”

Next we’ll install Chocolatey which is a package manager for Windows.

@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
Close Command Prompt and open it again to make Chocolatey available, remember to run it as administrator.

First we’ll install ruby.

choco install ruby -y
Close Command Prompt and open it once again to make Ruby available, remember to run it as administrator.
